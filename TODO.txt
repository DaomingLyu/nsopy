# Easy
- test coverage badge
- explain how to use loggers and util to record as csv (utils)
- config __init__.py such that you can do ``from nsopy import UniversalPGM''

# Harder / New features
- think about an example for structured mrf (not multiple choice)
- create wrapper nsoSolver(method='upgm', stopping=..., )
- use cutting planes or yosida to get a stopping criterion for ALL methods
- replace CP and BDL gurobi dependency with open source alternative?
- works on python 3? travis..
